# Coaching Techniques

## What is coaching?

Coaching is a process to discover and examine your assumptions, ways of thinking, expectations, beliefs, and reactions.

Coaching is different that mentoring.

| Mentoring   | Coaching  |
|---                                 | ---                    |
| Goal is teaching skills or guiding | Goal is self-reliance  |
| Give answers                       | Grow answers           |
| Mentor is a expert                 | Coach is a partner     |


## Why should you get a coach?

Coaching is a great way to grow your career. A coach can help you increase clarity and focus, hold yourself accountable for your commitments, build your leadership capabilities, increase your confidence and help you make BIG DECISIONS. In the business world, “You’re so broken you need a coach” has changed to “You’re so valuable you get a coach”.

Plus, many successful executives have coaches!

_"The coach doesn't have to play the sport as well as you do. They have to watch you and get you to be your best. In the business context a coach is not a repetitious coach. A coach is somebody who looks at something with another set of eyes, describes it to you in [his] words, and discusses how to approach the problem."_ ([link](http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2009/fortune/0906/gallery.best_advice_i_ever_got2.fortune/14.html))

## How to be a coach

The key to being a coach is to ask **open-ended questions** and employ **actively listening** to challenge assumptions. When someone states a problem, instead of responding with a quick answer, try leading with a question.


Your questions should not be judgmental, avoid asking "why?". Choose open evaluation over closed evaluation.

* **Good:** Walk me through your thought process? What’s working?
* **Bad:** Do you have a problem? Why do you keep doing things the same way if they're not working?

#### The Four Basic Steps

We break down coaching into the four steps listed below. You should be asking open-ended questions at every step!

 Name | Description | Example questions |
-------|-------------|-------------------
Context |  Figure out the context of the situation someone wants to talk about.  |  _What would you like to talk about?_
Content | Ask questions to understand what really matters to the person. | _What do you really want?_
Conduct | Probe into the changes or actions the person can do to help solve their problem. | _What will you do?_ _What's next?_
Commitment | How will the person hold themselves accountable? | _When will you do it?_ _What are you willing to commit to here?_



#### Tips & Tricks
* See yourself as a thought partner, listen for potential
* Keep your questions open-ended
* Encourage self discovery
* Be willing to be surprised
* Put your attention on the person in front of you, not the issue
* Remove any obstacles, provide resources
* Maintain accountability
* Celebrate effort and results! :star:

#### Advice from an expert

> This is another mindset shift - you shift from listening for the situation, to listening for the person. So it’s common when you listen to someone talk about a problem to be thinking about whether we agree/disagree, whether it makes sense, how we can help, how to connect what they’re saying to what we already know, what we would do. You feel this need to ask for more and more information so that we can really understand their situation.
The truth is we actually don’t need to know all about their situation - THEY know their situation. When you shift to listen for the person, you pay attention to what they reveal about their values, their motives, their needs… You can use open-ended questions to help them explore.

**Pro Tip:** WHAT questions have a tendency to focus outwards, towards action and the future.

**Pro Tip:** When in doubt, just employ active listening. "What I'm hearing is ...."
