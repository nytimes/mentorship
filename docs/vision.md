# Career Vision Worksheet ![badge](/docs/images/Badge.png)

Like any successful project, building a fulfilling career requires planning. These steps can help you define a career vision and identify clear steps to achieve it.

It is important to be open and honest with your mentor around these goals. Admitting gaps can feel vulnerable at times, but it is most important in order to grow in these areas.

### 1. Brainstorm unthinkable goals

This should be something you want to do, but you canâ€™t imagine being able to accomplish.

Some examples:
* Lead a large project
* Give a talk at a conference
* Write a book


Choose one unthinkable goal from above to focus on for the remainder of the steps and write it down below.
```
My unthinkable goal is ...











                                                                
```                                                                

### 2. Name your blockers

What are things you may do that will hold yourself back from reaching your goal? It's helpful to list all potential blockers before they happen so when they do happen, you'll have a plan.

Some examples:
* I want to lead a project at work BUT I missing X skill.
* I want to give a talk at a conference BUT I don't know conferences are good to submit to.
* I want to write a book BUT my day job is so draining, that I don't think I have the energy to do it.

```
My blockers are ...












                                                                      
```


### 3. Create a mantra
Create a phrase that encompasses your big goal. It should be something you can do moment by moment. The idea is to integrate the spirit of the high level goal into moment by moment interactions and everyday situations.

Some examples:
* My goal is to lead a project and my mantra is "I embrace learning new skills".
* My goal is to give a talk and my mantra is "I clearly explain ideas".
* My goal is to write a book and my mantra is "I observe the world".


```
My mantra is ...










```


### 4. Describe your starting point with respect to your goal.

List as much information as possible to help your mentor know where you are starting from.  Focus on facts first, craft the story later.

Some examples:
* My goal is to lead a project. I have worked at this company for x years and I have y years of experience in this area. I have no experience project planning, but I have worked closely with tech leads before.  

* My goal is to give a talk. I have presented at team meetings, but I have never written a talk proposal.

* My goal is to write a book. I have an idea for the book and I have a draft of the first chapter. I have a weekly writing group that I attend. I have never written a book fore.

```shell
My starting point is ...










```

### 5. Write a vision

Write a comprehensive vision for yourself. This is written as if you are in the future. Include your environment and your emotions. It's important to write a vision that you are excited about. Achieving ambitious goals requires hard work, the end result better be worth it!

Some examples:
* I just launched the first project that I was the lead on. I am proud of how the team worked together. We had to pivot a few times, but we achieved what we set out to. I've proven that I can run a project and my manager wants me to take on more responsibility going forward.  
* I just gave my first conference talk. I got a great reception and people have already reached out to me about giving the talk at their companies. I've also enjoyed meeting people at the conference and have had the opportunity to travel to a cool city.
* I just received a printed copy of my book and I'm trilled! I'm so proud of myself for accomplishing such an ambitious goal. The book has gotten good reviews and I'm going on a book tour next week.

```
My vision for myself is ...










```

### 6. Define SMART goals

It's important to break down big goals into small steps. SMART goals are goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-sensitive. What are the SMART goals to get to that vision?  Time-sensitive)

Some examples:
* My goal is to lead a project. One SMART goal is to meet with my manager in the next week to talk about the skills I should focus on in order to be choosen as a project lead.
* My goal is to give a talk at a conference. One SMART goal is to write down 25 different talk ideas by the end of this week and then get a colleague's feedback about them by the end of next week.
* My goal is to write a book. One SMART goal is to write for half an hour every day next week.

```
Some of my SMART goals are:

### 7. Make a celebration strategy

It's important to celebrate steps along the way to achieving our big goal. How will you celebrate each SMART goal? Be Specific.

Some examples:
* After I have the intimidating conversation with my boss about wanting to lead a project, I'm going to treat myself to a latte.
* After I write down my talk ideas and get feedback on them, I'm going to put a gold sticker on my goal planning notebook.
* After I complete my week of writing, I'm going to schedule drinks with my good friends.

```
I'm going to celebrate by ...










```

### 8. Write down if-thens

It's useful to predict road blocks and what you will do if they appear. Listing triggers and solutions will encourage new action. List at least 3 if-thens.

Some examples:
* If my manager doesn't think I'm ready to lead a project now, I will ask what I can work on and set up a meeting in 3 months to talk about it again.
* If my talk gets rejected, I will ask the organizers for feedback about why and submit it again somewhere else.
* If I'm not able to write at home because of all the distractions, I will pay for time at a co-working space.

```
Some of my if/then's are ...
